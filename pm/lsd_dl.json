"20061000": "They use their tusks to crush the berries they eat. Repeated regrowth makes their tusks strong and sharp.",
"20061200": "They are kind but can be relentless when defending territory. They challenge foes with tusks that can cut steel.",
"20061500": "They are born in snow clouds. They use chains made of ice crystals to capture prey.",
"20063300": "They cannot see, so they tackle and bite to learn about their surroundings. Their bodies are covered in wounds.",
"20072300": "It secretes flexible bubbles from its chest and back. The bubbles reduce the damage it would otherwise take when attacked.",
"20072400": "It can throw bubble-covered pebbles with precise control, hitting empty cans up to a hundred feet away.",
"20072500": "It creates throwing stars out of compressed water. When it spins them and throws them at high speed, these stars can split metal in two.",
"20075300": "While it’s an amiable Pokémon, if you touch it unexpectedly, it will heat up its body in an instant, and you’ll be burned.",
"20070400": "When they’re young, they live with a pride. Once they’re able to hunt prey on their own, they’re kicked out and have to make their own way.",
"20071311": "It’s not safe without the power of a flower, but it will keep traveling around until it finds one with the color and shape it wants.",
"20073300": "The organ that emits its intense psychic power is sheltered by its ears to keep power from leaking out.",
"20073400": "When in danger, it raises its ears and releases enough psychic power to grind a 10-ton truck into dust.",
"20074611": "Generations of kings were attended by these Pokémon, which used their spectral power to manipulate and control people and Pokémon.",

"20074200": "To entangle its opponents in battle, it extrudes white threads as sweet and sticky as cotton candy.",
"20075700": "It compresses the water it has sucked up and then projects it with enough power to punch a hole right through a thick sheet of iron.",
"20073900": "It lived in cold areas in ancient times. It’s said that when Amaura whinnies, auroras appear in the night sky.",
"20074000": "An Aurorus was found frozen solid within a glacier, just as it appeared long ago, which became quite a big event in the news.",
"20076300": "It uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move.",
"20073511": "The pumpkin body is inhabited by a spirit trapped in this world. As the sun sets, it becomes restless and active.",
"20075100": "Its ice-covered body is as hard as steel. Its cumbersome frame crushes anything that stands in its way.",

"20080900": "They smack beaks with others of their kind to communicate. The strength and number of hits tell each other how they feel.",
"20082800": "As they develop, their disposition grows more violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them too much to handle and abandon them.",
"20082911": "The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off.",
"20082912": "It has no problem ignoring orders it doesn’t like. It doesn’t seem to mind getting hurt at all—as long as it can finish off its opponent.",
"20080100": "They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off.",
"20084000": "It remains calm and unmoving no matter the situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its mouth to make a special kind of mud.",
"20085200": "It boasts power enough to split large trees in half. The organ on its rear releases an odor that it uses to communicate with others of its kind.",
"20085300": "It waves its hands wildly in intimidation and warning. Life is over for anyone who doesn’t run away as fast as possible.",
"20082300": "Each of its grains of sand has its own will. Palossand eats small Pokémon and siphons away their vital essence while they’re still alive.",
"20085400": "It lives in volcanoes and eats sulfur and other minerals. Materials from the food it eats form the basis of its explosive shell.",
"20085800": "When it’s surprised or agitated, the 14 fur spikes on its back will stand up involuntarily.",

"20000201": "There is a bud on this Pokémon’s back. To support its weight, Ivysaur’s legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it’s a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.",
"20005901": "Legends tell of its fighting alongside a general and conquering a whole country.",
"20009401": "You can hear tales told all over the world about how Gengar will pay a visit to children who are naughty.",
"20009501": "Onix has a magnet in its brain. It acts as a compass so that this Pokémon does not lose direction while it is tunneling. As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder and smoother.",
"20013101": "They’ve been so cherished that there’s now an overabundance. The fish Pokémon population has declined in waters with too many Lapras.",
"20015201": "In battle, Chikorita waves its leaf around to keep the foe at bay. However, a sweet fragrance also wafts from the leaf, becalming the battling Pokémon and creating a cozy, friendly atmosphere all around.",
"20015301": "Bayleef’s neck is ringed by curled-up leaves. Inside each tubular leaf is a small shoot of a tree. The fragrance of this shoot makes people peppy.",
"20015801": "Despite the smallness of its body, Totodile’s jaws are very powerful. While the Pokémon may think it is just playfully nipping, its bite has enough power to cause serious injury.",
"20015901": "Once Croconaw has clamped its jaws on its foe, it will absolutely not let go. Because the tips of its fangs are forked back like barbed fishhooks, they become impossible to remove when they have sunk in.",
"20016001": "Feraligatr intimidates its foes by opening its huge mouth. In battle, it will kick the ground hard with its thick and powerful hind legs to charge at the foe at an incredible speed.",
"20016701": "With threads from its mouth, it fashions sturdy webs that won’t break even if you set a rock on them.",
"20016801": "Every night, it wanders around in search of prey, whose movements it restrains by spewing threads before it bites into them with its fangs.",
"20021001": "While it has powerful jaws, it doesn’t care for disputes, so it rarely has a chance to display their might.",
"20023001": "Kingdra lives at extreme ocean depths that are otherwise uninhabited. It has long been believed that the yawning of this Pokémon creates spiraling ocean currents.",
"20024101": "It produces over five gallons of milk a day. The higher the quality of the pastures it lives in, the richer and tastier its milk becomes.",
"20024201": "Their eggs are such a delicacy that some say eating one will bring you happiness. These eggs fetch the highest prices on the market.",
"20027801": "With its long, thin wings, it catches updrafts and flies like a glider high up into the sky.",
"20027901": "It places small Pokémon into its spacious beak and carries them around. No one knows where it’s taking them.",
"20028301": "If it’s in a pinch, it will secrete a sweet liquid from the tip of its head. Syrup made from gathering that liquid is tasty on bread.",
"20028401": "Masquerain intimidates enemies with the eyelike patterns of its eyespots. If that doesn’t work, it deftly makes its escape on its set of four wings.",
"20029901": "It moves less than an inch a year, but when it’s in a jam, it will spin and drill down into the ground in a split second.",
"20032401": "You can tell how it’s feeling by the smoke spouting from its shell. Tremendous velocity is a sign of good health.",
"20035601": "Dusclops’s body is completely hollow—there is nothing at all inside. It is said that its body is like a black hole. This Pokémon will absorb anything into its body, but nothing will ever come back out.",
"20044801": "It concentrates its mental energy and fires off mysterious waves called auras, which can crush boulders of large size to dust.",
"20047601": "Although it can control its units known as Mini-Noses, they sometimes get lost and don’t come back.",
"20047701": "It is said to take lost spirits into its pliant body and guide them home.",
"20049501": "Being exposed to sunlight makes its movements swifter. It uses vines more adeptly than its hands.",
"20049601": "It moves along the ground as if sliding. Its swift movements befuddle its foes, and it then attacks with a vine whip.",
"20049701": "It only gives its all against strong opponents who are not fazed by the glare from Serperior’s noble eyes.",
"20049801": "It can deftly dodge its foe’s attacks while shooting fireballs from its nose. It roasts berries before it eats them.",
"20049901": "The more it eats, the more fuel it has to make the fire in its stomach stronger. This fills it with even more power.",
"20050001": "It can throw a fire punch by setting its fists on fire with its fiery chin. It cares deeply about its friends.",
"20051001": "Their beautiful form comes from the muscles they have developed. They run silently in the night.",
"20054401": "Protected by a hard shell, it spins its body like a wheel and crashes furiously into its enemies.",
"20054501": "It clasps its prey with the claws on its neck until it stops moving. Then it finishes it off with deadly poison.",
"20057901": "They use psychic power to control their arms, which are made of a special liquid. They can crush boulders psychically.",
"20058101": "Despite their elegant appearance, they can flap their wings strongly and fly for thousands of miles.",
"20060901": "Being consumed in Chandelure’s flame burns up the spirit, leaving the body behind.",
"20061201": "They are kind but can be relentless when defending territory. They challenge foes with tusks that can cut steel.",
"20080901": "They smack beaks with others of their kind to communicate. The strength and number of hits tell each other how they feel.",
"20082921": "The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off.",
