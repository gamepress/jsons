"20000200": "There is a bud on this Pokémon’s back. To support its weight, Ivysaur’s legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it’s a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.",
"20000300": "There is a large flower on Venusaur’s back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower’s aroma soothes the emotions of people.",
"20000301": "There is a large flower on Venusaur’s back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower’s aroma soothes the emotions of people.",
"20000400": "The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.",
"20000500": "Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive. In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with a bluish white color.",
"20000600": "Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.",
"20000700": "Squirtle’s shell is not merely used for protection. The shell’s rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.",
"20000800": "Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon’s toughness as a battler.",
"20000900": "Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate. They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.",
"20001300": "Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).",
"20001400": "Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares for its coming evolution. This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.",
"20001500": "Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.",
"20001600": "Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.",
"20001800": "This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.",
"20001900": "Its incisors grow continuously throughout its life. If its incisors get too long, this Pokémon becomes unable to eat, and it starves to death.",
"20002000": "People say that it fled from its enemies by using its small webbed hind feet to swim from island to island in Alola.",
"20002400": "The latest research has determined that there are over 20 possible arrangements of the patterns on its stomach.",
"20002500": "Its nature is to store up electricity. Forests where nests of Pikachu live are dangerous, since the trees are so often struck by lightning.",
"20002600": "As electricity builds up inside its body, it becomes more aggressive. One theory is that the electricity buildup is actually causing stress.",
"20002661": "It focuses psychic energy into its tail and rides it like it’s surfing. Another name for this Pokémon is “hodad.”",
"20002861": "It runs across snow-covered plains at high speeds. It developed thick, sharp claws to plow through the snow.",
"20002900": "Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison. They are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn.",
"20003000": "When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated from the others.",
"20003100": "Nidoqueen’s body is encased in extremely hard scales. It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young.",
"20003900": "Recordings of Jigglypuff’s strange lullabies can be purchased from department stores. These CDs can be found near the bedding area.",
"20004100": "It has no eyeballs, so it can’t see. It checks its surroundings via the ultrasonic waves it emits from its mouth.",
"20004200": "Every once in a while, you’ll see a Golbat that’s missing some fangs. This happens when hunger drives it to try biting a Steel-type Pokémon.",
"20004501": "Vileplume’s toxic pollen triggers atrocious allergy attacks. That’s why it is advisable never to approach any attractive flowers in a jungle, however pretty they may be.",
"20004800": "Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair that covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large eyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey.",
"20004900": "Venomoth is nocturnal—it is a Pokémon that only becomes active at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness.",
"20005200": "When visiting a junkyard, you may catch sight of it having an intense fight with Murkrow over shiny objects.",
"20005300": "This Pokémon is popular with rich people. It’s also targeted by hunters who are after the jewel in its forehead.",
"20005361": "In contrast to its lovely face, it’s so brutal that it tortures its weakened prey rather than finishing them off.",
"20005900": "Legends tell of its fighting alongside a general and conquering a whole country.",
"20006500": "Alakazam uses its psychic powers to make the spoons it carries. Each spoon is an original that there’s only one of in the whole world.",
"20006600": "Once this Pokémon has gained enough confidence and muscle from training with its friends, it challenges Makuhita to a battle.",
"20006800": "It grasps its opponents with its four arms and twists them up in an intricate hold. People call it “the Machamp special.”",
"20006900": "Bellsprout’s thin and flexible body lets it bend and sway to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth, this Pokémon spits a corrosive fluid that melts even iron.",
"20007000": "Weepinbell has a large hook on its rear end. At night, the Pokémon hooks on to a tree branch and goes to sleep. If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself on the ground.",
"20007100": "Victreebel has a long vine that extends from its head. This vine is waved and flicked about as if it were an animal to attract prey. When an unsuspecting prey draws near, this Pokémon swallows it whole.",
"20007400": "Geodude that have lived a long life have had all their edges smoothed out until they’re totally round. They also have a calm, quiet disposition.",
"20007461": "If you mistake it for a rock and step on it, it will headbutt you in anger. In addition to the pain, it will also zap you with a shock.",
"20007500": "It climbs up cliffs as it heads toward the peak of a mountain. As soon as it reaches the summit, it rolls back down the way it came.",
"20007561": "When two Graveler fight each other, it fills the surroundings with flashes of light and sound. People call it the “fireworks of the earth.”",
"20007600": "When Golem grow old, they stop shedding their shells. Those that have lived a long, long time have shells green with moss.",
"20007700": "Ponyta is very weak at birth. It can barely stand up. This Pokémon becomes stronger by stumbling and falling to keep up with its parent.",
"20007800": "Rapidash usually can be seen casually cantering in the fields and plains. However, when this Pokémon turns serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze as it gallops its way up to 150 mph.",
"20008100": "It’s frequently the cause of power outages, which is why some power plants send out electrical signals that it can’t stand.",
"20008600": "Thanks to its thick fat, cold seas don’t bother it at all, but it gets tired pretty easily in warm waters.",
"20008700": "It swims through the ocean at a speed of eight knots, searching for Pokémon that will become its prey. It’s especially fond of Wishiwashi.",
"20008800": "It was born from sludge on the ocean floor. In a sterile environment, the germs within its body can’t multiply, and it dies.",
"20008900": "Their food sources have decreased, and their numbers have declined sharply. Sludge ponds are being built to prevent their extinction.",
"20009300": "On moonless nights, Haunter searches for someone to curse, so it’s best not to go out walking around.",
"20009400": "You can hear tales told all over the world about how Gengar will pay a visit to children who are naughty.",
"20009500": "Onix has a magnet in its brain. It acts as a compass so that this Pokémon does not lose direction while it is tunneling. As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder and smoother.",
"20010000": "Voltorb was first sighted at a company that manufactures Poké Balls. The link between that sighting and the fact that this Pokémon looks very similar to a Poké Ball remains a mystery.",
"20010100": "Electrode eats electricity in the atmosphere. On days when lightning strikes, you can see this Pokémon exploding all over the place from eating too much electricity.",
"20010200": "Six of them form a single Pokémon. Should one of the six be lost, the next morning there will once more be six.",
"20012100": "Its sparkling core is called “the gem of the sea.” This core can be made into high-priced accessories that are traded in secret.",
"20012300": "Its two sharp scythes are more than just weapons. It uses them with dexterity to dress its prey before eating.",
"20012700": "Although it’s tough, it can’t handle cold well. When night falls, it buries itself in leafage and sleeps.",
"20012800": "They live in groups. The one with the longest, thickest, and most-scarred horns is the boss of the herd.",
"20013100": "They’ve been so cherished that there’s now an overabundance. The fish Pokémon population has declined in waters with too many Lapras.",
"20014000": "This Pokémon thrived 300 million years ago. It’s said that living specimens can still be seen in a certain region—a rare sight.",
"20014100": "Its body had begun to change so it could function on land. But it didn’t adapt in time and went extinct.",
"20014200": "Restored from DNA found in amber, this Pokémon exhibited ferocity that was greater than expected. Some casualties resulted.",
"20014700": "It’s still weak, so it lurks on the floor of bodies of water, eating whatever food sinks down and living a quiet life.",
"20014900": "It flies over raging seas as if they were nothing. Observing this, a ship’s captain dubbed this Pokémon “the sea incarnate.”",
"20015000": "Mewtwo is a Pokémon that was created by genetic manipulation. However, even though the scientific power of humans created this Pokémon’s body, they failed to endow Mewtwo with a compassionate heart.",
"20015100": "Mew is said to possess the genetic composition of all Pokémon. It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people.",
"20015200": "In battle, Chikorita waves its leaf around to keep the foe at bay. However, a sweet fragrance also wafts from the leaf, becalming the battling Pokémon and creating a cozy, friendly atmosphere all around.",
"20015300": "Bayleef’s neck is ringed by curled-up leaves. Inside each tubular leaf is a small shoot of a tree. The fragrance of this shoot makes people peppy.",
"20015401": "The fragrance of Meganium’s flower soothes and calms emotions. In battle, this Pokémon gives off more of its becalming scent to blunt the foe’s fighting spirit.",
"20015500": "Cyndaquil protects itself by flaring up the flames on its back. The flames are vigorous if the Pokémon is angry. However, if it is tired, the flames splutter fitfully with incomplete combustion.",
"20015600": "Quilava keeps its foes at bay with the intensity of its flames and gusts of superheated air. This Pokémon applies its outstanding nimbleness to dodge attacks even while scorching the foe with flames.",
"20015700": "Typhlosion obscures itself behind a shimmering heat haze that it creates using its intensely hot flames. This Pokémon creates blazing explosive blasts that burn everything to cinders.",
"20015800": "Despite the smallness of its body, Totodile’s jaws are very powerful. While the Pokémon may think it is just playfully nipping, its bite has enough power to cause serious injury.",
"20015900": "Once Croconaw has clamped its jaws on its foe, it will absolutely not let go. Because the tips of its fangs are forked back like barbed fishhooks, they become impossible to remove when they have sunk in.",
"20016000": "Feraligatr intimidates its foes by opening its huge mouth. In battle, it will kick the ground hard with its thick and powerful hind legs to charge at the foe at an incredible speed.",
"20016800": "Every night, it wanders around in search of prey, whose movements it restrains by spewing threads before it bites into them with its fangs.",
"20016900": "Its fangs are so sharp, if it bites you in the dark and sucks your blood, you won’t notice any pain or realize you’ve been bitten.",
"20017801": "It’s said that while this Pokémon has the power to predict the future, it’s not powerful enough to change the future it sees.",
"20018300": "Marill’s oil-filled tail acts much like a life preserver. If you see just its tail bobbing on the water’s surface, it’s a sure indication that this Pokémon is diving beneath the water to feed on aquatic plants.",
"20018700": "This Pokémon drifts and floats with the wind. If it senses the approach of strong winds, Hoppip links its leaves with other Hoppip to prepare against being blown away.",
"20018800": "Skiploom’s flower blossoms when the temperature rises above 64 degrees Fahrenheit. How much the flower opens depends on the temperature. For that reason, this Pokémon is sometimes used as a thermometer.",
"20018900": "Jumpluff rides warm southern winds to cross the sea and fly to foreign lands. The Pokémon descends to the ground when it encounters cold air while it is floating.",
"20019700": "This Pokémon is nocturnal. Even in total darkness, its large eyes can spot its prey clearly!",
"20020801": "Steelix lives even further underground than Onix. This Pokémon is known to dig toward the earth’s core. There are records of this Pokémon reaching a depth of over six-tenths of a mile underground.",
"20021000": "While it has powerful jaws, it doesn’t care for disputes, so it rarely has a chance to display their might.",
"20021800": "Molten magma courses throughout Slugma’s circulatory system. If this Pokémon is chilled, the magma cools and hardens. Its body turns brittle and chunks fall off, reducing its size.",
"20022400": "The ink it spits when escaping is special. It contains a substance that dulls the sense of smell, so Pokémon with keen noses get lost.",
"20022500": "It shares its food with people who are stranded. Because Delibird is omnivorous, sometimes it gives those people bug Pokémon.",
"20022900": "They spew flames mixed with poison to finish off their opponents. They divvy up their prey evenly among the members of their pack.",
"20022901": "They spew flames mixed with poison to finish off their opponents. They divvy up their prey evenly among the members of their pack.",
"20023000": "Kingdra lives at extreme ocean depths that are otherwise uninhabited. It has long been believed that the yawning of this Pokémon creates spiraling ocean currents.",
"20023100": "For its nest, Phanpy digs a vertical pit in the ground at the edge of a river. It marks the area around its nest with its trunk to let the others know that the area has been claimed.",
"20024100": "It produces over five gallons of milk a day. The higher the quality of the pastures it lives in, the richer and tastier its milk becomes.",
"20024200": "Their eggs are such a delicacy that some say eating one will bring you happiness. These eggs fetch the highest prices on the market.",
"20024800": "It wanders through the mountains seeking opponents to fight. If it finds an opponent that’s not worthy, Tyranitar ignores it and wanders on.",
"20025000": "Ho-Oh’s feathers glow in seven colors depending on the angle at which they are struck by light. These feathers are said to bring happiness to the bearers. This Pokémon is said to live at the foot of a rainbow.",
"20025200": "Treecko has small hooks on the bottom of its feet that enable it to scale vertical walls. This Pokémon attacks by slamming foes with its thick tail.",
"20025300": "The leaves growing out of Grovyle’s body are convenient for camouflaging it from enemies in the forest. This Pokémon is a master at climbing trees in jungles.",
"20025400": "The leaves growing on Sceptile’s body are very sharp edged. This Pokémon is very agile—it leaps all over the branches of trees and jumps on its foe from above or behind.",
"20025500": "Torchic sticks with its Trainer, following behind with unsteady steps. This Pokémon breathes fire of over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit, including fireballs that leave the foe scorched black.",
"20025600": "Combusken toughens up its legs and thighs by running through fields and mountains. This Pokémon’s legs possess both speed and power, enabling it to dole out 10 kicks in one second.",
"20025700": "In battle, Blaziken blows out intense flames from its wrists and attacks foes courageously. The stronger the foe, the more intensely this Pokémon’s wrists burn.",
"20026100": "At first sight, Poochyena takes a bite at anything that moves. This Pokémon chases after prey until the victim becomes exhausted. However, it may turn tail if the prey strikes back.",
"20026700": "Beautifly’s favorite food is the sweet pollen of flowers. If you want to see this Pokémon, just leave a potted flower by an open window. Beautifly is sure to come looking for pollen.",
"20026800": "Cascoon makes its protective cocoon by wrapping its body entirely with a fine silk from its mouth. Once the silk goes around its body, it hardens. This Pokémon prepares for its evolution inside the cocoon.",
"20026900": "Dustox is instinctively drawn to light. Swarms of this Pokémon are attracted by the bright lights of cities, where they wreak havoc by stripping the leaves off roadside trees for food.",
"20027100": "Lombre is nocturnal—it will get active after dusk. It is also a mischief maker. When this Pokémon spots anglers, it tugs on their fishing lines from beneath the surface and enjoys their consternation.",
"20027400": "Nuzleaf live in densely overgrown forests. They occasionally venture out of the forest to startle people. This Pokémon dislikes having its long nose pinched.",

"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_0402_0600_10": "Well, I won’t let you win so easily next time.\nI’m going to continue to reach for the top—it will\nbe me who triumphs when we meet again.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_0700_10": "That reminds me... You mentioned you were\ncurious about something earlier, Steven?",

"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_0900_10": "You know, I’ve actually been curious about the\nvery same thing! Are those stones part of your\nfashion, or...?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1000_10": "They are! I’ve always thought they fit well with\nmy style. There’s no special meaning behind them\nor anything, though.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1100_10": "Curious... But even if that’s the case, your\nplacement of the stones and choice of color\nare brilliant!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1200_10": "You may not put much thought into it, but you’ve\nclearly breathed life into those stones.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1300_10": "Oh, I agree completely! It’s a wondrous hairstyle.\nNothing short of beautiful!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1400_10": "With your fashion sense, you and your Pokémon\ncould easily take first place in a beauty contest!",

"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_2500_10": "Of course it was. Building a friendship with\nsomeone as bright and encouraging as you\nhas been a big part of my journey.",

"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_3300_10": "Oh, they’re fine! There’s no hard feelings between\nthem or anything like that.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_3400_10": "More importantly, let’s get to the part where you\ntell us about Ho-Oh!",

"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_3600_10": "As I’m sure you’ve heard, Ho-Oh is a beautiful\nPokémon that possesses magnificent,\nseven-colored wings.",

"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_3800_10": "It creates a rainbow just by flying... Now that’s\na fitting story for a Legendary Pokémon if I’ve\never heard one.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_3900_10": "There are stories about Dragonair being able to\nchange the weather, but transforming the sky?\nThat seems even more incredible to me.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_4000_10": "Ho-Oh is also said to live at the foot of\na rainbow.",

"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_4500_10": "Ah, do forgive me. I was so captivated, I lost\nmyself in thought for a moment.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_4600_10": "I-I see...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_4700_10": "Wow! There’s all kinds of legends about it! I feel\nlike I learned a lot just now!",

"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_5000_10": "Ah!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_5100_10": "As I recall, the legends say Ho-Oh has appeared\nin Ecruteak City at the Bell Tower and the burned\nremains of the Brass Tower.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_5200_10": "Perhaps it prefers elevated locales? It does fly\nthrough the sky, after all.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_5300_10": "Elevated locales... What’s the closest thing to a\ntower here on Pasio? A mountain maybe?",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_5400_10": "Of course! We just have to climb a mountain and\nsee what we can find!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_5500_10": "Thanks, Valerie! You taught me a whole lot\njust now!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_5600_10": "Ah, before you go, there is one more thing I just\nremembered. It’s actually rather important.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_5700_10": "Important?",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_5800_10": "Ho-Oh will not reveal itself to just anyone.",

"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_6300_10": "OK, then! [Name:PlayerNickname ], Silver!\nWe’re going mountain climbing tomorrow!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_0301_6400_10": "We better wake up bright and early!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_0401_6500_10": "That’s right! We’ve gotta search every nook and\ncranny of that mountain! We can’t leave a single\nstone unturned!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_0302_6600_10": "We better start preparing, then!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_0402_6700_10": "Haha! Don’t worry, I’m bringing my trusty camping\ngear. You could come empty-handed and we’d be\ntotally covered!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_6800_10": "Don’t keep us waiting, either, Silver!",

"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_7200_10": "I don’t really care about Ho-Oh. I’ve just been\nalong for the ride this whole time.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_7300_10": "You two can go without me.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_7400_10": "Later.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_7500_10": "H-hold on, Silver! What’s gotten into you all\nof a sudden?",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_7600_10": "We’ll be waiting for you tomorrow at the base of\nthe mountain, Silver! Don’t forget!",

"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5004_1001_0400_10": "Besides, I’ve got you.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5004_1001_0500_10": "And even if I did go...what if my presence\nkeeps Ho-Oh away from the area altogether?\n*sigh*",

"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_0200_10": "That’s not why I’m here. I just want to talk.\nThat’s all.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_0300_10": "It’s been a while since you and I have had a\nchance to talk like this.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_0400_10": "When we first met, the only thing you cared about\nwas obtaining strong Pokémon that could lead you\nto victory.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_0500_10": "The thought of loving or trusting your Pokémon\nnever once occurred to you.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_0600_10": "That’s why you lost to me.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_0700_10": "Tsk! If you only came here to rub salt in old\nwounds, I’m leaving.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_0800_10": "But you’re different now.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_0900_10": "I can tell by looking at your Sneasel.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_1000_10": "That Pokémon has formed a deep bond with you.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_1100_10": "Pokémon are happiest when they’re with the\nperson they care about the most.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_1200_10": "For it to trust you this much...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_1300_10": "It can only mean that your adventures in Johto and\nyour time with Ethan have changed you, Silver.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_1400_10": "You keep talking like that, people might\nthink you’ve retired the cape to become\na Pokémon Professor.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_1500_10": "You’re no longer the person you once were.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_1600_10": "You’ve become a purehearted Trainer.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_1700_10": "... ... ...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_1800_10": "You think it’s that easy for people to change?",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_1900_10": "I’m a Trainer who’s done some pretty terrible\nthings. I stole someone’s Pokémon, and I treated\npeople like garbage if they got on my nerves.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_2000_10": "And worst of all, my dad is...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_2100_10": "... ... ...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_2200_10": "Even so, I believe in you.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_2300_10": "That’s why you should believe in yourself, too.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_2400_10": "... ... ...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_2500_10": "Don’t be a no-show tomorrow.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_2600_10": "Your friends [Name:PlayerNickname ] and\nEthan will be waiting for you.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_2700_10": "They’re not my friends.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_2800_10": "They’re rivals, not friends!\nAnd that goes for you, too!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_2900_10": "I haven’t forgotten what it felt like when you\ncompletely destroyed me in battle.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_3000_10": "I’m going to get stronger here on Pasio! I’m going\nto become the greatest Trainer in the world!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5005_1001_3100_10": "And when I do, I’m coming for you! You’d better\nbe ready!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_0100_10": "Silver is rather late. I wonder if he’s actually\ngoing to come.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_0200_10": "Don’t say that! Silver’s definitely gonna show up!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_0300_10": "When we were traveling all over Johto, he’d show\nup wherever I was...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_3500_10": "and more often than not, I’d show up wherever\nhe was.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_0400_10": "We’re rivals! That’s why I know he’ll come today!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_0301_0500_10": "You really believe in him, huh?",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_0401_0600_10": "Yup! We’ve had our ups and downs along the\nway, but he’s a good guy!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_0302_0700_10": "I know he’ll show up!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_0402_0800_10": "Thanks for believing in Silver, too,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_0900_10": "Well said. When you put it like that, I suppose\nwe should wait a little longer.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_1000_10": "Yeah. Thanks. I’m glad you came along,\ntoo, Valerie.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_1100_10": "But won’t it be hard for you to climb in that outfit?",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_1200_10": "I appreciate your concern, but I’ll be fine.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_1300_10": "It just means I’ll need to work even harder if I\nwant to see Ho-Oh.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_1400_10": "All right, party’s over...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_1500_10": "Silver!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_1600_10": "I knew you’d show up!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_1700_10": "Hmph! What’re you so happy about?",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_1800_10": "My goal is to be the greatest Trainer in the world.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_1900_10": "If Ho-Oh does decide to show up...maybe I’ll just\nmake it my partner by force!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_2000_10": "I’m not just gonna stand around and watch while\none of you idiots gets to join up with Ho-Oh.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_2100_10": "Hehe! You’re gonna try to make Ho-Oh your\npartner now, Silver? Sounds like you’re pretty\nfired up!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_2200_10": "But if you think I’m gonna lose, think again!\nI’m gonna find it first—",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_2300_10": "That’s the same cry I heard yesterday...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_2400_10": "That can only mean Ho-Oh really is somewhere\non this mountain!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_2500_10": "It’s on! Time to see which of us finds Ho-Oh first!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_2600_10": "H-hey!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_2700_10": "Hehe. I suppose I shall give it my all, too.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_2800_10": "Hmph! How can they be so casual about this?\nDon’t they realize they’re going up against a\nLegendary Pokémon?",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_2900_10": "Still...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_3000_10": "If they find it first, I’ll be pretty upset...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_3100_10": "Let’s go, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! We’re going\nto be the first ones to find Ho-Oh, not them!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_3200_10": "Looks like they’re after the same thing we are.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_3300_10": "But that darling Ho-Oh will be mine! All mine!\nSurely it was fate that led me here to meet it!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5006_1001_3400_10": "Call for backup! I want those little pests gone!\nThen that lovely Ho-Oh will have no choice but\nto be mine!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_0100_10": "We’ve been climbing for what feels like forever\nand haven’t seen so much as Ho-Oh’s shadow.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_0200_10": "But I’ve heard its cry a few more times since we\nstarted, so we must be getting closer.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_0301_0300_10": "Let’s keep looking. Don’t give up!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_0401_0400_10": "Of course. I still have to prove that I’m the\ngreater Trainer.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_0302_0500_10": "Maybe Ethan already found it.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_0402_0600_10": "Not a chance. I know Ethan. If he found it already,\nhe would’ve told us by now.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_0402_0700_10": "That’s the kind of guy he is. Believe me, I’ve spent\nmore time with Ethan than I’d care to admit.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_0800_10": "Speaking of which...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_0900_10": "you kinda remind me of him.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_0301_1000_10": "Really?",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_0401_1100_10": "Yeah. Not in terms of appearance or personality.\nIt’s more...your eyes.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_0302_1200_10": "How so?",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_0402_1300_10": "I’d say it’s your eyes.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_1400_10": "They’re always looking off to the distance, giving\noff this kinda...gleam. It used to really annoy me\nwhenever I saw eyes like yours.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_1500_10": "But...now I don’t really get that way around\nyou or Ethan.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_1600_10": "The old me definitely would’ve just challenged you\nto a battle and not thought twice about it.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_1700_10": "Maybe I’m...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_1800_10": "What was that? It sounded close!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_1900_10": "Ah!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_2000_10": "Ho-Oh... It’s really here.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_2100_10": "Does that mean I’m...? No, it’s because you’re\nhere. Right, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_2200_10": "Gah! It doesn’t matter! That’s not important now!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_2300_10": "Ho-Oh! Now that you’ve finally revealed yourself,\nI’m going to make you my partner Pokémon!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_2400_10": "You want to see how strong I am? Then let the\nbattle begin!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_2500_10": "Tsk! Who’d be calling me now? This better\nbe important...",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_2600_10": "Huh? Ethan? Actually, this is perfect.",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_2700_10": "Hey, Ethan! Guess what we just fou—",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_2800_10": "Silver! You’ve gotta get over here!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_2900_10": "A bunch of Team Break goons are attacking\nTrainers up here on the mountain!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_3000_10": "What?!",
"legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5007_1001_3100_10": "I’m trying to find a safe place for us to hide\nright now, but those jerks are probably right\non our tails!",
