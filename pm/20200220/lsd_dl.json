"20000200": "There is a bud on this Pokémon’s back. To support its weight, Ivysaur’s legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it’s a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.",

"20001400": "Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares for its coming evolution. This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.",
"20001500": "Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.",
"20001600": "Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.",
"20001800": "This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.",
"20001900": "Its incisors grow continuously throughout its life. If its incisors get too long, this Pokémon becomes unable to eat, and it starves to death.",
"20002500": "Its nature is to store up electricity. Forests where nests of Pikachu live are dangerous, since the trees are so often struck by lightning.",
"20002600": "As electricity builds up inside its body, it becomes more aggressive. One theory is that the electricity buildup is actually causing stress.",
"20002661": "It focuses psychic energy into its tail and rides it like it’s surfing. Another name for this Pokémon is “hodad.”",
"20002900": "Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison. They are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn.",
"20003000": "When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated from the others.",
"20003100": "Nidoqueen’s body is encased in extremely hard scales. It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young.",
"20004100": "It has no eyeballs, so it can’t see. It checks its surroundings via the ultrasonic waves it emits from its mouth.",
"20004501": "Vileplume’s toxic pollen triggers atrocious allergy attacks. That’s why it is advisable never to approach any attractive flowers in a jungle, however pretty they may be.",
"20004800": "Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair that covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large eyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey.",

"20005900": "Legends tell of its fighting alongside a general and conquering a whole country.",

"20007100": "Victreebel has a long vine that extends from its head. This vine is waved and flicked about as if it were an animal to attract prey. When an unsuspecting prey draws near, this Pokémon swallows it whole.",

"20007500": "It climbs up cliffs as it heads toward the peak of a mountain. As soon as it reaches the summit, it rolls back down the way it came.",
"20007561": "When two Graveler fight each other, it fills the surroundings with flashes of light and sound. People call it the “fireworks of the earth.”",
"20007700": "Ponyta is very weak at birth. It can barely stand up. This Pokémon becomes stronger by stumbling and falling to keep up with its parent.",
"20007800": "Rapidash usually can be seen casually cantering in the fields and plains. However, when this Pokémon turns serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze as it gallops its way up to 150 mph.",
"20008100": "It’s frequently the cause of power outages, which is why some power plants send out electrical signals that it can’t stand.",
"20008600": "Thanks to its thick fat, cold seas don’t bother it at all, but it gets tired pretty easily in warm waters.",
"20008700": "It swims through the ocean at a speed of eight knots, searching for Pokémon that will become its prey. It’s especially fond of Wishiwashi.",
"20008800": "It was born from sludge on the ocean floor. In a sterile environment, the germs within its body can’t multiply, and it dies.",
"20008900": "Their food sources have decreased, and their numbers have declined sharply. Sludge ponds are being built to prevent their extinction.",
"20009300": "On moonless nights, Haunter searches for someone to curse, so it’s best not to go out walking around.",
"20009400": "You can hear tales told all over the world about how Gengar will pay a visit to children who are naughty.",
"20009500": "Onix has a magnet in its brain. It acts as a compass so that this Pokémon does not lose direction while it is tunneling. As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder and smoother.",

"20010100": "Electrode eats electricity in the atmosphere. On days when lightning strikes, you can see this Pokémon exploding all over the place from eating too much electricity.",
"20010200": "Six of them form a single Pokémon. Should one of the six be lost, the next morning there will once more be six.",
"20012100": "Its sparkling core is called “the gem of the sea.” This core can be made into high-priced accessories that are traded in secret.",
"20012700": "Although it’s tough, it can’t handle cold well. When night falls, it buries itself in leafage and sleeps.",
"20013100": "They’ve been so cherished that there’s now an overabundance. The fish Pokémon population has declined in waters with too many Lapras.",
"20014700": "It’s still weak, so it lurks on the floor of bodies of water, eating whatever food sinks down and living a quiet life.",
"20014900": "It flies over raging seas as if they were nothing. Observing this, a ship’s captain dubbed this Pokémon “the sea incarnate.”",
"20015000": "Mewtwo is a Pokémon that was created by genetic manipulation. However, even though the scientific power of humans created this Pokémon’s body, they failed to endow Mewtwo with a compassionate heart.",
"20015100": "Mew is said to possess the genetic composition of all Pokémon. It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people.",
"20015200": "In battle, Chikorita waves its leaf around to keep the foe at bay. However, a sweet fragrance also wafts from the leaf, becalming the battling Pokémon and creating a cozy, friendly atmosphere all around.",
"20015300": "Bayleef’s neck is ringed by curled-up leaves. Inside each tubular leaf is a small shoot of a tree. The fragrance of this shoot makes people peppy.",
"20015401": "The fragrance of Meganium’s flower soothes and calms emotions. In battle, this Pokémon gives off more of its becalming scent to blunt the foe’s fighting spirit.",
"20015500": "Cyndaquil protects itself by flaring up the flames on its back. The flames are vigorous if the Pokémon is angry. However, if it is tired, the flames splutter fitfully with incomplete combustion.",
"20015600": "Quilava keeps its foes at bay with the intensity of its flames and gusts of superheated air. This Pokémon applies its outstanding nimbleness to dodge attacks even while scorching the foe with flames.",
"20015700": "Typhlosion obscures itself behind a shimmering heat haze that it creates using its intensely hot flames. This Pokémon creates blazing explosive blasts that burn everything to cinders.",
"20015800": "Despite the smallness of its body, Totodile’s jaws are very powerful. While the Pokémon may think it is just playfully nipping, its bite has enough power to cause serious injury.",
"20015900": "Once Croconaw has clamped its jaws on its foe, it will absolutely not let go. Because the tips of its fangs are forked back like barbed fishhooks, they become impossible to remove when they have sunk in.",
"20016000": "Feraligatr intimidates its foes by opening its huge mouth. In battle, it will kick the ground hard with its thick and powerful hind legs to charge at the foe at an incredible speed.",
"20016800": "Every night, it wanders around in search of prey, whose movements it restrains by spewing threads before it bites into them with its fangs.",
"20016900": "Its fangs are so sharp, if it bites you in the dark and sucks your blood, you won’t notice any pain or realize you’ve been bitten.",
"20017801": "It’s said that while this Pokémon has the power to predict the future, it’s not powerful enough to change the future it sees.",
"20018300": "Marill’s oil-filled tail acts much like a life preserver. If you see just its tail bobbing on the water’s surface, it’s a sure indication that this Pokémon is diving beneath the water to feed on aquatic plants.",

"ch0002_00_kotone/2501_0701_05_10": "It could also be the way you interact  with your Pokémon. You really cherish  your Pokémon, don’t you?",

"ch0091_00_shirona/0602_0702_03_10": "There’s so much variety here on Pasio. The creator must really have a mind for hospitality, assuming all of this was a conscious decision.",

"ch0091_00_shirona/0604_0701_02_10": "Maybe that’s why she’s been such a ball of energy ever since we got to Pasio.",
"ch0091_00_shirona/0604_0701_03_10": "It’s up to me to channel all of that energy and make the most out of it in a battle.",
"ch0091_00_shirona/0604_0702_01_10": "Back when she was a Gible, she’d gnaw on fabric, books, and even tables! It was a pain to deal with at the time, but she was just so cute...",
"ch0091_00_shirona/0604_0702_02_10": "Thinking back on those days always makes me laugh. She used to be such a naughty thing, but look at her now! My brilliant ace.",

"ch0099_00_jun/1701_0701_02_10": "I’ve already got one. One what? This item, of course!",
"ch0099_00_jun/1701_0702_01_10": "I could learn a lot from the way you use items.",

"charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_0401_2800_10": "Yeah, Professor Birch and May. They’re my next-door neighbors.",

"charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_0402_3000_10": "Yeah, like Professor Birch and May have. They’re my next-door neighbors.",

"charaepi_ch0019_00_yuki/2301_1201_3200_10": "But thinking like that is just me running away. While clashing can be tough, it might actually be fortunate at the same time.",

"charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_1201_3500_10": "Aw, man... I think the paint got messed up, though. Granbull must have chewed on it a little bit.",

"charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0401_3700_10": "Well, I AM pretty proud of it!",
"charaepi_ch0034_00_matsurika/2301_0401_3800_10": "You know, I don’t even really mind that it got ruined. It’s enough for me just knowing that Granbull loved it!",

"charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_0402_1100_10": "Mew is called a Mythical Pokémon. Few have ever even caught a glimpse of it.",
"charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_1200_10": "What’s the problem, you old geezer?",

"charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_1800_10": "Oh ho! That’s quite the expression! It reminds me of how you used to be back in the old days!",
"charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_1900_10": "So, what are you going to do? Don’t tell me you’re satisfied just with seeing Mew?",
"charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_0301_2000_10": "Mew looks ready for battle!",

"charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_2600_10": "I’m going to challenge Mew to a battle!",
"charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_2700_10": "Talk about bottomless energy! Mew seems like it could take on a whole crowd of opponents and still want more afterwards!",
"charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_2800_10": "More than battling, it looks like it’s just playing and having fun!",
"charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_2900_10": "Yes. Mew’s nature, its habits, and just about everything about it are all shrouded in mystery.",
"charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_3000_10": "However, having a battle with it has allowed me to unravel at least one of those mysteries today.",

"charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_3300_10": "That’s why Mew used so many different moves in our battle!",

"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4002_1001_3000_10": "Well, what will it be, boys? If you insist on robbing my friends, you’ll have to get through me first. I can take you all on at once, if you like.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4002_1001_3100_10": "Y-you sure talk a big game! Better watch out— we’ll be back for you!",

"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4002_1001_3400_10": "Hahaha! Told you we’d be back for you! And this time, we brought a few buddies along for the ride!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4002_1001_3500_10": "We’ve got you so outnumbered, yo! Hope you like gettin’ pounded to dust!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4002_1001_3600_10": "Hm. Dust, he says... What do you think, Champion?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4002_1001_3700_10": "*sigh* The stone will have to wait. I have some ruffians to take care of first.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_0100_10": "There are more of them than I thought. This may take a bit longer...",

"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_0300_10": "These grunts aren’t much of a challenge. Come on, Wallace. Let’s take care of these last few stragglers.",

"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_0700_10": "I’m sorry if I startled you... I couldn’t help but be impressed.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_0800_10": "Look at Steven... He doesn’t waste a single movement with his commands, and Metagross matches him at every beat.",

"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1100_10": "Ah, my apologies. I’m Grant, the Gym Leader of Cyllage City in the Kalos region.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1200_10": "I was just doing some rock-climbing on the cliffs over there when I spotted you all training.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1300_10": "When I heard the commotion, I decided to head this way to see if anything was wrong.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1400_10": "I didn’t expect to see such an expert display...",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1500_10": "Well, one must come to expect this level of mastery when Steven is around.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1600_10": "He was particularly merciless back there, too... Perhaps it’s because his opponents were trying to steal stones.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1700_10": "Steven can be quite sensitive when it comes to stones. Cross him, and he turns into an entirely different person!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1800_10": "It seems you all lucked out today! Not everyone gets the chance to witness the sheer power of Steven and his Metagross.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1900_10": "Speaking of which, I trust your stone came out of this fiasco safe and sound, Barry?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2000_10": "Snap, I almost forgot! I’ve got it right here. I wonder why those thugs were trying to steal it in the first place. It looks pretty ordinary to me.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2100_10": "Can I borrow it for a moment, Barry? I think you may be surprised...",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2200_10": "What? Whoa! Are you serious?! Look how pretty it is!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2300_10": "This stone may look ordinary on the outside, but it’s actually quite rare. It’s called a geode. Those are crystals on the inside.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2400_10": "It takes years and years for the crystals to form into something beautiful like this.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2500_10": "They must have brought in rock and soil from other regions when they were building up these mountains.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2600_10": "Pasio’s origins as an artificial island come with all sorts of surprises, it seems. I never thought I’d find a geode like this here.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2700_10": "It’s really incredible, if you think about it.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2800_10": "Whoaaa! That’s so cool! I’ve never even seen a stone like this before!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2900_10": "Well, the largest ones can fetch a good price in the shop, but I doubt those ruffians understand the true beauty and value of these stones.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_0301_3000_10": "Do you have any stones like this already, Steven?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_0401_3100_10": "I do, in fact. I have quite a variety of rare geodes in my personal collection.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_0302_3200_10": "Do you want this stone, too?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_0402_3300_10": "Oh, no. That one is for you to keep! I actually have quite a variety of rare geodes in my personal collection.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_3400_10": "If you’re curious, you can always stop by and see the collection yourself.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_3500_10": "Pardon me, but... Um, Steven? Would it be all right if I challenge you to a Pokémon battle?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_3600_10": "I’ve been hoping for an opportunity like this since I first heard the rumors about you.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_3700_10": "It’s something I’ve looked forward to for a long time. What do you say?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_3800_10": "Of course! Challenge accepted. How are you feeling, Wallace?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_3900_10": "To be honest, a break would be nice. Barry, [Name:PlayerNickname ], this one is all yours.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_4000_10": "All right! Let’s do this!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_4100_10": "You’ve actually got me curious about something, Grant.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_4200_10": "Really? What is it?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_4300_10": "Let’s save that for after the battle, shall we?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_0100_10": "Whew... Defeating the Champion is a wall that I am unable to surmount.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_0200_10": "Aw, man! That was the rockiest battle I’ve been through in a long time!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_0301_0300_10": "You were really strong!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_0401_0400_10": "That’s my line! Your teamwork was amazing. Truly a sight to behold!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_0302_0500_10": "Bet we could beat you again!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_0402_0600_10": "Well, I won’t let you win so easily next time. I’m going to continue to reach for the top—it will be me who triumphs when we meet again.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_0700_10": "That reminds me... You mentioned you were curious about something earlier, Steven?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_0800_10": "Yes. I wanted to ask you about the stones you use in your hair.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_0900_10": "You know, I’ve actually been curious about the very same thing! Are those stones part of your fashion, or...?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1000_10": "They are! I’ve always thought they fit well with my style. There’s no special meaning behind them or anything, though.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1100_10": "Curious... But even if that’s the case, your placement of the stones and choice of color are brilliant!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1200_10": "You may not put much thought into it, but you’ve clearly breathed life into those stones.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1300_10": "Oh, I agree completely! It’s a wondrous hairstyle. Nothing short of beautiful!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1400_10": "With your fashion sense, you and your Pokémon could easily take first place in a beauty contest!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1500_10": "Oho! I knew it! The secret’s in the stones, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1600_10": "Grant was super strong, too, right? I mean, he’s a Gym Leader!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1700_10": "I’m right, aren’t I? The secret to your strength has to do with your stones, right?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1800_10": "I do have a thing for stones. You’re right about that much. But it goes deeper than that.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1900_10": "I travel the world in search of interesting stones, but so much happens along the journey before I ever find a single one.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_2000_10": "I get to encounter all sorts of people and Pokémon along the way, as well as experience the beauty of nature.",

"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_2200_10": "So if there really is a secret key to my strength...",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_2300_10": "I’d say it’s having something I’m passionate about and appreciating all of the experiences I have as I follow my passion.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_2400_10": "Was meeting me one of those experiences, hm?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_2500_10": "Of course it was. Building a friendship with someone as bright and encouraging as you has been a big part of my journey.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_2600_10": "Everyone knows that I have plenty of strength on my own in a battle.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_2700_10": "But when I have a friend battling at my side, I can be even stronger than that.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_2800_10": "I think we share a lot of things in common.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_2900_10": "You’re as passionate about stones as you are about Pokémon battling, and it’s the same way with me and sports.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_3000_10": "My love for sports is like a driving force that keeps me moving forward...",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_3100_10": "and the experience I gain along the way is something I can use in my battles, too.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_3200_10": "So, essentially...the journey that comes with collecting stones and the experience gained from playing sports influence the way you two battle.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_3300_10": "That! Yes! I finally get it! The secret to being strong is having something you love!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_3400_10": "For me, maybe that’s Pokémon! Do you think my love for Pokémon can make me a super-awesome Trainer in the future, too?!",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_3500_10": "I think so. Both of you have kept up with us fairly well as we’ve battled our way up this mountain.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_3600_10": "And you were definitely on the right track in that tussle with the masked thugs earlier, as well as in our battle with Grant just now.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_3700_10": "If Pokémon battling is already something that you love, I’m sure you’re well on your way to becoming great Trainers someday.",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_3800_10": "So keep following your passions, all right?",
"episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_3900_10": "Once you’re confident in your strength, you should come challenge me in Hoenn.",

"episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_1500_10": "Everything! The two may seem different on the surface, but deep down both are forms of art that share the same philosophy.",

"episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_1900_10": "I want a Pokémon battle and a cooking battle... Er...cook-off? Yeah, a cook-off! And I’m gonna go all out for both!",
"episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_2000_10": "All right. If you want to prove yourself that badly, then Rosa and I have no choice but to accept your challenge with utmost hospitality.",
"episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_2100_10": "In fact, I had a few uniforms imported to Pasio in case a situation like this were to arise! Rosa, could you fetch them for me, please?",

"episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0300_10": "Huh. It must be a stowaway from the parcel our uniforms were sent in. I’m not sure how it got here...but it may be just what we need.",
"episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0400_10": "Hospitality is the most important quality of any good chef, and if there’s any Pokémon that knows the true meaning of hospitality, it’s Delibird.",
"episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0500_10": "If you spend some quality time with Delibird, its kind, charitable nature may rub off on you. It can help you grow as a chef!",
"episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0501_10": "Octillery has opened my eyes to a whole new realm of culinary possibility since we first met... Perhaps it will be the same for you.",

"episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1000_10": "So? What do you think of my dish?! I call it the special Z-Set! Olivia and Hau are huge fans of it back in Alola.",

"episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1300_10": "Yes. It’s certainly an acquired taste... I taste intense creativity—a flavor that immediately gets my brain buzzing.",
"episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1400_10": "*gasp* Goodness gracious! I just thought of a new recipe! I need to begin prepping right away.",
"episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1500_10": "No, wait! I lack the ingredients to fully execute it right now. First, I’ll have to gather everything I need.",

"episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1800_10": "What? Oh, no... You’re too kind.",

"episode_event_wataru_shirona_01/4004_1001_1300_10": "Ohhh, of course! You’re a dragon master, too! I hadn’t even thought about that.",
"episode_event_wataru_shirona_01/4004_1001_1400_10": "It’s true that you’re strong, Clair. And it’s good to have confidence in your own abilities...",
"episode_event_wataru_shirona_01/4004_1001_1500_10": "but there’s a limit to what’s good and what’s not. Too much pride can make you overconfident, and overconfidence can make you vulnerable.",

"episode_event_wataru_shirona_01/4004_1001_1700_10": "To get back to your question, Rosa, I think I share Cynthia’s feelings about the title of who’s “the greatest.”",

"episode_event_wataru_shirona_01/4004_1001_2200_10": "But eventually, a stronger Trainer came along, and even he was defeated... It was then that I realized something.",
"episode_event_wataru_shirona_01/4004_1001_2300_10": "That title—“the greatest”—can inflate your ego, but it doesn’t really mean anything. It’s an illusion, there one minute and gone the next...",
"episode_event_wataru_shirona_01/4004_1001_2400_10": "The way I see it, seeking to grow and improve yourself is far more worthwhile than chasing a fleeting illusion of greatness.",
"episode_event_wataru_shirona_01/4004_1001_2500_10": "Mhmm... Wow, that’s so deep. You Champions really are on a whole different level. I should be taking notes!",

You cannot control the other players’ <span class='word'>sync pairs</span> on the left or right during battle.<br> Also, you cannot have 2 or more <span class='word'>sync pairs</span> that include Trainers with the same name in your team.",
"35": "<span class='word'>Sync pairs</span> can be temporarily affected by several different conditions and effects during battle. These effects are listed below.<br> Confused: The <span class='word'>Pokémon</span> can potentially hit itself instead of an opponent when using a <span class='word'>move</span>. It lasts until the <span class='word'>Pokémon</span> uses a certain number of <span class='word'>moves</span> or until the <span class='word'>sync pair</span> is switched out.<br> Flinching: Causes the <span class='word'>Pokémon</span> to flinch, making it unable to perform a <span class='word'>move</span>. While flinching, the <span class='word'>move</span> gauge fills more slowly. It lasts for a fixed amount of time, until the <span class='word'>sync pair</span> uses its <span class='word'>sync move</span>, or until it’s switched out. It will also end if the Pokémon is put to sleep or frozen.<br> Trapped: The affected <span class='word'>sync pair</span> can no longer be switched out, and the <span class='word'>Pokémon</span> takes damage after every action. It lasts until the Pokémon uses a certain number of <span class='word'>moves</span>. <br> No Evasion: <span class='word'>Moves</span> against the target always hit (except in certain circumstances). It lasts for a fixed amount of time or until the <span class='word'>sync pair</span> is switched out. <br> Type Resistance: Temporarily grants resistance to one of the following 18 <span class='word'>move</span> types: Normal, Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Ice, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Ghost, Dragon, Dark, Steel, or Fairy. The damage the target takes from <span class='word'>moves</span> of the specified type is reduced. It lasts until the <span class='word'>sync pair</span> is switched out. <br> Enduring: After being hit by a <span class='word'>move</span> that would otherwise cause them to faint, the Pokémon endures with 1 HP remaining.   However, being hit by a unity attack, a <span class='word'>sync move</span>, or certain other moves can nullify this effect. It works once or lasts until the <span class='word'>sync pair</span> is switched out.<br> Gradual Healing: HP gradually recovers with every action performed by the <span class='word'>Pokémon</span>. It works until the Pokémon uses a certain number of <span class='word'>moves</span> or until the <span class='word'>sync pair</span> is switched out. <br> Condition Nullification: Prevents all status conditions as well as certain other conditions inflicted by opponents. It lasts for a fixed amount of time or until the <span class='word'>sync pair</span> is switched out. <br> Sure Hit Next: The next <span class='word'>move</span> always hits (except in certain circumstances). It works until the Pokémon uses a <span class='word'>move</span> or until the <span class='word'>sync pair</span> is switched out. <br> Critical Hit Next: The next attack is always a critical hit (except in certain circumstances). The attack itself may miss, however. It works until the Pokémon uses a <span class='word'>move</span> or until the <span class='word'>sync pair</span> is switched out.",
